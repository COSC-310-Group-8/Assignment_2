For our testing we used JUnit to create three test cases for major functions of our program.

NovaBotTest: Tests the getResponse() and getFollowup() methods to see if they return the write response given the emotion. 
We also did this for one of the unexpected topics ("depressed"). In addition, we have a test method for getGreeting(). 
The tests for getResponse and getFollowup use another method to check if the response or followup returned is what it should be given a certain emotion.
The tests for getResponse(for an expected topic) and getGreeting simply check if the methods output what they are supposed to.

POSTaggerTest: This test case checks if the POSTagger is correctly extracting the adjectives from a sample sentence.

UserfeelingsTest: This test case checks if the findEmotion() method in Userfeelings is correctly identifying the emotion given a sentence. It uses the POS tagger to
extract the adjectives from a sentence and checks if the findEmotion() method can correctly set what emotion it is.
