I can sense your frustration, but try to remain calm and think clearly.
Dealing with things can be quite irritating, so I can see why you are angry.
It is normal for things to get under our skin, but it is important not to let them control us.
You seem quite upset. Understand that it's normal and okay to feel this way.
